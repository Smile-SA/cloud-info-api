## Contributing to Cloud Info API

If you wish to help us on the mission to improve the project, you are welcome to submit us
- Bugs report
- Code contribution
- Feature suggestions

Every enhancement starts by opening an issue, to which we'll answer and iterate over.
Properly written issues, with examples or logs describing the behavior, are easier to understand for everyone and have a better chance to have positive feedback.

## Bugs report
Before reporting a bug, please check that no existing issues are mentioning the same problem. In this case, adding a comment in the issue describing your case, with new information, can be helpful for everyone.
Otherwise, open a new issue and describe us your problem.

## Feature suggestions
Features suggestions will be gladly received.
Please be explicit when describing the desired behavior, along with potential technical suggestions, as a better comprehension of the demand can only bring positive results.

## Feature suggestions
To contribute code, either select an issue you want to work on or open a new one, then assign yourself.
It is always best to discuss your plans beforehand, to ensure that your contribution goes in the right direction.
